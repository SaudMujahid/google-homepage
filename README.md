Hey there! I am Saud Mujahid, i am from Bangladesh and this was my first project i created. It was a quite challenging, understanding the box model, flexbox and how to arrange items, styling the plain html to look modern, adding images, etc etc. Basically everything was tough to grasp but after having spend hours experimenting different styles and trying out other ways to achieve the same look and feel to my desired outcome, i was satisfied with this one.  Using live server did make life much more easier aswell as clearing my confussion. 
Anyways thats all for my breif experience. This for sure will not be my last work ;)
